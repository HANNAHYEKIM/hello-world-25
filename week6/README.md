This game draws inspiration from the classic Tamagotchi device.  
It's a simple simulation with four main functions, each represented as a button on the screen.

The Tamagotchi is a keychain-sized virtual pet simulation game where players can feed, care for, and nurture a digital creature.

And here, this is my version of Tamagotchi :)

1) Feed:
When you press 'Feed,' the creature grows larger.
Every five feedings, it produces a poop, which appears at random on the screen.

2) Love:
Pressing the 'Love' button changes the creature's color to pink for a brief period, indicating it's received your affection.

3) Poop:
The screen can get cluttered with poops over time. The 'Poop' button remove all poops from the view.

4) Reset:
If you need to start over, you use the 'Reset' button. This action restores the creature to its original size, as it appeared when the game started.

This game is a straightforward homage to the Tamagotchis, focusing on simple interactions between the user and the virtual creature.  
While recreating a game I often played in my childhood, I found myself growing fond of the little circle. ⚪️
