There are countless games in the world, but when I hear the word 'game', 8-bit classics immediately pop into my mind. 
(To be honest, I'm not a game person üòÇ)

So when I was given an assignment, the idea of "Game" was the first thing that came to me.  
That's why I decided to go for an 8-bit game-inspired design.

Back in my childhood days, 'Super Mario' was a favorite thing with my older sister! :)

Thus, I created pixels in the style of 8-bit games, using the iconic 'Super Mario' color palette.  
These games hold a lot of childhood memories for me.

And this is a result ‚¨áÔ∏è
