There are countless games in the world, but for me, the term 'game' instantly brings to mind 8-bit games.  
(Admittedly, I'm not much of a gamer though 😂)

So when I was given an assignment to create custom pixels, the concept of "Game" immediately sprung to my mind.  
Thus, I decided to craft an output that exudes an 8-bit game vibe.

In my younger days, I spent many hours playing 'Super Mario' with my sister! :)  

Like this ⬇️

Therefore, it seemed only fitting that I would attempt to create an '8-bit game style' visual using the iconic color palette of 'Super Mario'.  

And this is a result ⬇️
