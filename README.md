At first, I tried to create different combinations with just circles and colors.
All of a sudden, I looked at the cup on my desk and realized it was the same pattern I was creating!

So I set the color to black and tried to create a pattern similar to the cup. 
This is my favorite cup I brought back from Korea, and it was fun to create it in Python! :)
